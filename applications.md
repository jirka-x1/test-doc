## Applications (Advanced Transformation)

* applications tend to be used for more complex manipulations
* applications can be reused in multiple projects
* applications can be branded and offered to other customers KBC market-place
* applications' code have to be programmed outside of KBC (the R or SQL code of transformations is modified within KBC)

Applications can be provided by Keboola or 3rd parties.
